# UltimateClock
This program takes the time from your computer and displays it and the time in 23 other cities in different time 
zones. On the clock it displays the time and date of a particular city. You can toggle between the different 
cities by typing 'A' or 'a' and 'D' or 'd' on the keyboard. 'A' shifts the clock time down an hour whereas 
'D' shifts the time up an hour. You can also type 'S' or 's' to switch the clock from a digital clock to a 
analog clock and vice versa.
